# Attention Concatenation Volume for Accurate and Efficient Stereo Matching
Stereo matching is a fundamental building block for many vision and robotics applications. An informativeand concise cost volume representation is vital for stereo matching of high accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we present a novel cost volume construction method whichgenerates attention weights from correlation clues to suppress redundant information and enhance matching-relatedinformation in the concatenation volume.
